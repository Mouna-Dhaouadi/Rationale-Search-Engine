Refine validator and `<iden>` validator configuration  ;This commit ensures that a primary JSR 303 and `<iden>` will be exposed if the auto-configuration kicks in. As `<iden>` exposes 3 contracts (JSR-303 `<iden>` and `<iden>` as well as the `<iden>` validator one), this makes sure that those types can be injected by type. `<iden>` exposes 3 contracts and were only checking for the absence of a `javax.validation.<iden>` to auto-configure a `<iden>`. If no standard JSR validator exists but a <iden>s `<iden>` exists and is primary, we shouldnt flag the auto-configured one as `<iden>`. Previous iterations on this feature have made sure that well auto-configure at most one `javax.validation.<iden>` so not flagging it `<iden>` is no problem. This commit also restores and adds tests that validate `<file_name>` will configure a JSR validator even if a <iden> is present. This effectively fixes `<issue_link>` in a different way.
