Decision;Rationale
None;None
None;Most gfp.h inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.
Build test were done on the following configurations and failures were fixed ;None
CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests;"my distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles

Decision: a few more options had to be turned off depending on archs"
percpu.h modifications were reverted;so that it could be applied as a separate patch and serve as bisection point
I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch;Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6
fix oom kill behavior;None
handle panic_on_oom=always case;None
clean up mm_counter;None
modify implementation of per-mm counter;reducing patch size in future patch
fix oom killing a child process in an other cgroup;memcg, oom killing, child process, other cgroup
This patch fixes it.;None
avoid oom-killing innocent task in case of use_hierarchy;None
fix for this bug;fix
fixes the arg for mem_cgroup_print_oom_info();fixes
Print information of mem_cgroup;The task being killed, not current, belongs to mem_cgroup
fix NUMA constraint check with nodemask;NUMA constraint check with nodemask
Fix node-oriented allocation handling in oom-kill.c;bugfix
adds vsz and rss information to the oom log;to help this analysis
This patch displays the oom killer header whenever it panics;bug reports can include pertinent information to debug the issue, if possible
Don't need to care multi thread in here;None
oom_score should be calculated as per-process;None
select_bad_process();it makes consistency more and makes speed up
select_bad_process() must select killable task;killable task
it should be per-process value;OOM-killer kill a process, not thread
