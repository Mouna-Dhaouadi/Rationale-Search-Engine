Since <iden> always creates an <iden> if it doesn't find one already registered, it makes sense to also make it into a  @bean . <iden> does not register its <iden> by default though, so we have to do that for it if the user has created one with an  <iden>  <iden>, but not registered it as a  @bean . <enter> Having the  @bean  (marked  @primary  to prevent issues with  <iden> ) makes it easier to reason about what <iden> has done for you, and easier to default in simple use cases to the boot-created <iden>. For example, if I want an OAuth2 Authorization Server with password grant, it makes total sense for the <iden> for users to be the same as the  @primary  one. Now it is easy to set that up (just  @autowire  it). ;Register an <iden> in security autoconfig  ;it helps a lot
