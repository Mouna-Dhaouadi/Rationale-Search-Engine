Decision;Rationale
Fixed typo;
Fix <method_name> ( <pr_link> );<method_name> should not match when the given <iden> has no failures
Wrap the invocation of <iden>() within a try-catch block  ;Exceptions from <iden>() were causing unrooted tests
Fix dead link to the ant task in <file_name> (<pr_link>);"The link is dead; task has been moved to another location"
Fix many warnings (Eclipse <version>/Juno based);Enh: add new 'staticondemandthreshold' setting to eclipse project jdt.ui preference settings file

Implemented the changes proposed by davidhart82;proposed by davidhart82
Fixes imports;
Restore backward compatibility with sub class of <file_name> that override <iden> method and Add <file_name> to <file_name> suite;To ensure backward compatibility with subclasses and include <file_name> in the <file_name> suite
`<file_name>` should be in junit*.zip  ;
Updated <file_name>;
Better validation in <file_name> ;Improve validation
A <file_name> can be explicitly passed to a <iden> class that needs one in its constructor.;This eliminates the ugly global constant <file_name> in <file_name>, and breaks the cyclic dependency between runners and requests
Invalid assumptions, failed tests, and ignored tests now all print similarly;
Remove unnecessary comments;unnecessary
New <iden> implementation makes <file_name> crazy simple;
<file_name> handles filtering and sorting for all runners, now including <file_name>;handles filtering and sorting for all runners
Ignored tests should be shown differently in stack trace section of report;ignored
Moved <file_name> into proper package;proper
No matching parameters is now an assumption failure, not an assertion failure;an assumption failure
Now includes filtering;
Pull <iden> up into <file_name>;reorganization of code

Removed  <file_name> , replaced with  <file_name> , which moved to model package with  <file_name> ;moved to model package
Renamed link classes  ;Absolute actions are verbs, ActionModifiers are modifying phrases, Moved isShadowedBy(List) to <file_name>
Created a separate <file_name> directory for new <file_name> scripts, including FTP upload;Organizing and structuring directories for new scripts
Updated README  ;about Enclosed
Deprecate rule  <file_name>  ( <pr_link> )  ;The method Assert.assertThrows provides a nicer way for verifying exceptions. In addition the use of  <file_name>  is error-prone when used with other rules like TestWatcher because the order of rules is important in that case.
Disable parts of doclint for the site's javadoc;That commit is missing to apply the doclint rules to site generation. Hence the site goal fails because of doclint issues. Now doclint is disabled for all groups but accessibility and reference for the site generation.
Adding additional javadoc context for deprecated <method_name>, Adding <file_name> entry for pholser, Starting <version> release notes;for deprecated <method_name>, for pholser, starting release notes

Fix method names;in <method_name>
Improve error message when <method_name> fails;
Make  <file_name>  abstract  ;Fix issue 30
Create <file_name> in org.junit.runners.model and deprecate the one in org.junit.internal.runners.model. Update <file_name> to have a useful message. This allows developers who write custom runners to properly handle multiple exceptions without depending on internal classes.;Provides a more organized structure for custom runners and reduces dependencies on internal classes.
Improve error message  ;the thrown exception has the same class but the classes are loaded from different class loaders
Cleaning up compile errors;from reverting hamcrest change

Added better <file_name>;
<method_name> did not work reliably.;Was assuming that the <iden> used for JUnit could also load test classes.
