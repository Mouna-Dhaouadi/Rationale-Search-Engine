Having this value on the Killed process message is useful to\\ndocument if a miscconfiguration occurred or to confirm that the\\noom_score_adj configuration applies as expected.\\n\\nAn example which illustates both misconfiguration and validation that the\\noom_score_adj was applied as expected is:\\n\\nAug 14 23:00:02 testserver kernel: Out of memory: Killed process 2692\\n (systemd-udevd) total-vm:1056800kB, anon-rss:1052760kB, file-rss:4kB,\\n shmem-rss:0kB pgtables:22kB oom_score_adj:1000\\n\\nThe systemd-udevd is a critical system application that should have an\\noom_score_adj of -1000.
